# BST-Algorithm-Visualizer-

ðŸŒ² Binary Search Tree (BST) Visualizer
A dynamic, interactive web application designed to help users understand the concepts, operations, and behavior of Binary Search Trees (BSTs) in real-time. This project serves as a hands-on educational tool and a demonstration of efficient front-end data structure visualization.

âœ¨ Key Features
Interactive Operations: Supports fundamental BST operations, including Insertion, Deletion, and Search, with animated node movements.

Traversal Visualization: Clearly demonstrates the different traversal algorithms:

In-order: (Left â†’ Root â†’ Right)

Pre-order: (Root â†’ Left â†’ Right)

Post-order: (Left â†’ Right â†’ Root)

Performance Metrics: Displays the current height of the tree and the time complexity of each operation (O(logn) for a balanced tree) to reinforce DSA concepts.

Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
